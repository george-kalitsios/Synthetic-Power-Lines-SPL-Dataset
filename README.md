# Synthetic-Power-Lines-SPL-Dataset
The large-scale **Synthetic Power Lines (SPL) dataset** was generated using unity, one of the most popular gaming engines in the world, and unity's perception package. The introduced dataset contains aerial images of power lines in every possible combination of different locations, lighting conditions, tilts, angles, FOVs. The SPL dataset consists of **12,850 high resolution 1920x1080 images**, with 5,770 collected from the first and 7,080 from the second unity-created virtual worlds, as shown in Table 1, and randomly divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing.
