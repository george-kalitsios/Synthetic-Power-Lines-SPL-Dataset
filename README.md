# Synthetic-Power-Lines-SPL-Dataset
The large-scale Synthetic Power Lines (SPL) dataset was generated using unity, one of the most popular gaming engines in the world, and unity's perception package. The introduced dataset contains aerial images of power lines in every possible combination of different locations, lighting conditions, tilts, angles, FOVs.
